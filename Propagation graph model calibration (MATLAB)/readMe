This folder contains the MATLAB code for calibrating the Propagation Graph (PG) model using the kernel-based ABC method proposed in 
A. Bharti, F.-X. Briol, and T. Pedersen, “A general method for calibrating stochastic radio channel models with kernels,” IEEE Trans. on Antennas and Propag., 2021. 
(available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9445690).

main.m:         This is the main file to run the code.
param1.mat:     This file consists of the M=2000 values of the four model parameters sampled from the prior distribution. See the main file for prior boundaries of parameters.
data_moments1.mat and data_moments2.mat:  These two files contain the first four simulated temporal moments from the PG model for the parameter values in param1.mat. 
                The files are split due to issue of file size. The data from these two files are combined in the main file.
