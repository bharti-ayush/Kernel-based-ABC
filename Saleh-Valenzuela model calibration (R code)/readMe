This folder contains the R code for calibrating the Saleh-Valenzuela model using the kernel-based ABC method proposed in 
A. Bharti, F.-X. Briol, and T. Pedersen, “A general method for calibrating stochastic radio channel models with kernels,” IEEE Trans. on Antennas and Propag., 2021.

functions.R:    file containing all the relevant functions needed to run the main.R file. Load these functions in the environment before running the main.R file.
param.rds:      consists of M=2000 parameter values sampled from the uniformly distributed prior distribution. The prior ranges for all the parameters are given in main.R file. 
                In case the prior ranges are changed, the parameter values should be sampled again.
S.rds:          The log temporal moments simulated from the Saleh-Valenzuela model coresponding to the parameters in param.rds. The dimension of S is 100x4x2000 (NxKxM), where
                N is the number of realizations of each temporal moment, K is the number of temporal moments used, and M is number of parameter samples.
